# SharkPCB project

This is a project to make a freely available, open-source 40% keyboard Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The board is compatible with Planck plates and cases and supports three layouts: full grid, 1x2U spacebar and 2x2U spacebar.

The gerber files also contain plate files, from which plates can be made of FR4 (the same material as the circuit board) in the same factory as the PCB itself.
